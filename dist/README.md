Project - Pokemon Api Challenge
For this project, I used a pokemon api to retrieve data about a pokemon, and displayed that data on a styled website. For the styling of the website, I first used figma to create my website layout and design, and I mainly used html, tailwind and css for the styling and structure of my website. For the functionality of the website I used javascript, where I created lots of async and regular functions to display the pokemon data.

Peer Review: Design is very good. I like that the background changes depending on which pokemon is on the screen. The over placement and flow of the website makes for a good user experience. The little things like hover effects and even the text on the left letting the user know that the image is clickable was good choice. 
- everything functions as it should and the responsiveness has no clunky break points. 
- small critiques: text for abilities, moves, and description could be cleaned up alittle bit by removing the unnecessay '-'s and the '\f's. Also capitilzing words that need to be capitalized 

Edit: I cleaned up the moves and abilities by creating a function for them. But I couldn't clean up the description.
