Peer Review: Design is very good. I like that the background changes depending on which pokemon is on the screen. The over placement and flow of the website makes for a good user experience. The little things like hover effects and even the text on the left letting the user know that the image is clickable was good choice. 
- everything functions as it should and the responsiveness has no clunky break points. 
- small critiques: text for abilities, moves, and description could be cleaned up alittle bit by removing the unnecessay '-'s and the '\f's. Also capitilzing words that need to be capitalized
